This is a character mod for Slay The Spire, using the ProTemplate by DarkVexon and Alchyr.

This character is based off the other 4 base game characters and the world of Slay The Spire,
and is intended to be an idea of what a 5th base game character would look like. In terms of
mechanics and card design, this means I tried to create complementary mechanics to the watcher.

My character's mechanics include:
Stamina: the complement of Vigor,
Return: the complement of Retain,
Plan: the complement of Scry,
Instead of cards that react to the previous card you played, I made many cards that
react to factors outside the player's control such as enemy intents.
The main mechanic of the Lonely is Companions, which is designed to value consistency every turn,
and most of the other mechanics reinforce the idea of being consistent.
But consistency is boring, so the remaining mechanics are designed to break the consistency, with
one mechanic being "cultist cards" which provide Strength at a cost.
The last mechanic are what I call "Broken Cards", which give you debuffs in exchange for an effect
and generating a card of a higher rarity.
Also, throughout most of these cards, my character displays his innate power to "overcome any weakness".

I am not an Artist, but I tried my best to make this mod look as good as it plays. @ocean made all the
energy-related art, and I made the rest. I spent 3 years designing, coding, and drawing for this mod
and I hope you agree with me that all that time was well spent.
