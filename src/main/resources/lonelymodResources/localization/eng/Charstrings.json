      "Navigating an unlit street, you come across several hooded figures in the midst of some dark ritual. As you approach, they turn to you in eerie unison. The tallest among them bares fanged teeth and extends a long, pale hand towards you. NL ~\"Join~ ~us~ ~brother,~ ~and~ ~feel~ ~the~ ~warmth~ ~of~ ~the~ ~Spire.\"~",
      "#y~ANGER.~ NL NL ~\"The~ ~power~ ~to~ ~overcome~ ~any~ ~weakness?\"~ What a JOKE. NL NL Those words from God sound as weak in your mind as your bruised body feels on the hot sand. NL NL \"If I cannot be their ruler, then I will be their end!\" NL NL Your words seem to disappear between the dry, white trees. NL NL \"I'll come back!\" You promise to yourself as the tall structure behind you slowly disappears into the horizon."
